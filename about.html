        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
        <h2>WHY SHOULD I VISIT NEPAL?</h2>
        <p>Nepal is an enchanting kingdom, nestled in the Himalayas between China and India. For a small territory, the
          country boasts an uncommonly diverse terrain, including 8 of the world's top 10 highest mountains. Nepali
          folklore is often illustrated in dance and music and the people are open to sharing their traditions. Although
          tourism is steadily increasing, Nepal's remote location has kept the culture widely unaffected from outside
          influences.</p> <br><br>
  
  
  
        <h2>WHAT SHOULD I PACK?</h2>
  
        <p>It all depends on your destination and season of travel. Generally speaking, Nepal is a conservative country.
          We recommend that travelers not wear clothing that is too short tight, or revealing. Medium-weight and easy to
          wash cottons are recommended year-round in the Kathmandu valley. From October to February, we also suggest
          woolen sweaters, jackets or similar warm outfits. Pack comfortable walking shoes, including sandals and athletic
          shoes. A head cover may be required for women and men at sacred sites and places of worship. For trekking and
          adventure itineraries, a list of suggested clothing items and supplies will be provided.</p> <br><br>
  
  
  
  
        <h2>WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO TRAVEL?</h2>
        <p>It really depends on your destination, activities and season of travel. Our destination specialists will
          recommend certain travel times after learning more about your preferences. The favorable months are usually
          September – November and February – April. The monsoon season is June – August.</p><br><br>
  
  
  
        <h2>ARE VACCINATIONS REQUIRED?</h2>
        <p>Immunizations are not required to visit Nepal. (Exception: if you are traveling from an area infected with
          Yellow Fever, you must have a certificate.) Depending on the season and region of travel, certain
          vaccinations and/ or medications are suggested and we will recommend preventative measures. We do encourage
          all travelers to be current on routine immunizations. Also, we recommend the Tetanus and Hepatitis A
          vaccine. Though still rare, Malaria is increasing in Nepal. The elevation of Kathmandu and places of greater
          altitude are too high for the species of mosquito that carries malaria. However, when visiting lowland
          areas, preventive treatment and tropical strength insect repellent is advised.</p> <br><br>
  
  
        <h2>DO NEPALESE SPEAK ENGLISH?</h2>
        <p>Nepali is the official language. It has roots in Sanskrit and is written in Devengari script. English is
          understood by most people in the cities. In the villages, different ethnic groups speak their own languages.
